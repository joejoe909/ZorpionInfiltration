# Zorpion Infiltration
#### Download the repo and then use the powerpoint or pdf manual to see my designs. 
#### You can see my design notes to get an idea of how i design as I work on this project. 
#### Zorpion Infiltration is a basic python text based game as a school project.
***
## Current state
#### The movement is setup.
#### Exit the game by pressing a number rather than typing exit.
#### Rather than using a mov command, you use options.
#### The Dr. (the player) is randomly placed on the map.
#### You can navigate the map infinitely.
***
## Story
#### You are apart of scientific expedition into deep space when a part of the ship is breeched by a strange
#### creature that has killed off most of the crew. You have to lure it to a room with incineration vac to kill and
#### expunge it from the ship. 
***
## Items you can get to help you.
####		Jet pack – will increase space traveled to 1  capsules per move (2 sectors).
####		An electric shock taser – Causes the Zorpion to lose movement.
####		A shield increases damage points.
####		Droid – can move in your place and can be used to lure the Zorpion to
####		different parts of the ship.

##        TODO: 
####            We still need to get a good calculation for zorpion movement.
####            We are now starting classes in class, mvoe to oo design. 
***
## Run the game. 
##### go to the target directory and type: python zi.py
##### currently movement will cause some key related errors because of lack of logic on the zorpion movement.
##### user movement is fully functional dont mess with it unless to make it more efficent and to clean it up.
